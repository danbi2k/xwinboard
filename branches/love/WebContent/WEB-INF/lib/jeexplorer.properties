#
# Home directory
# --------------
# The home, or root, directory for the explorer.
#
# It can be specified as either:
# - a relative path (f.ex. /jeexplorer means www.yoursite.com/jeexplorer)
# - an absolute path (f.ex. c:/jeexplorer or /usr/home/jeexplorer)
#
# The home directory setting can be overridden individually per user,
# by setting the attribute name and value on the user's session.
# F.ex., calling request.getSession().setAttribute("home_dir", "c:/userdata/johnny");
# will set the explorer home dir for that user to c:/userdata/johnny.
home_dir=C:/

# ---------------------------------------
# The maximum size of file the user is allowed to upload.
#
# A negative value means unlimited file sizes.
#
# The setting can be overridden individually per user, by setting the attribute name
# and value on the user's session.
# F.ex., calling request.getSession().setAttribute("max_upload_size_kb", "250");
# will set the max file upload for that user to 250 kb.
